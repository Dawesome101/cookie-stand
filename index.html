        <p>Pat is totaly awesome.</p><br>
        <p>He's the kinda guy who does everything he can to help everyone he see's. Like helping little old ladies cross
          the street and getting cats out of trees. As cool as it is to be super nice, being nice wasn't Pats only goal
          in life. Pat wanted to be a cookie baker and was searching for the right idea to make his brand really stand
          out above the others.</p><br>
        <p>One day, while deep in thought, Pat was strolling down by pikes place market. The fish throwers were tossing
          fish back and forth like they always do and as chance would have it, one of those fish mongers loosed a
          sideways fish toss and the catcher lost control of it. It sailed through the air and struck good ol' Pat right
          in the face. Suprissed, he stumble back, arms streched and bumped right into a little boy eating a choclate
          chip cookie. The bump wasn't very hard, but it was just hard enough to send that cookie sailing out of his
          hand and right into the icey fish on display. The kid looked at his cookie, then back at Pat, then to the
          cookie again. For a second, it looked as if tears were welling up in his eyes but instead, the boy stood up
          straight and marched over to the cookie which was laying in the ice right next to the salmon. He grabbed it
          and walked over to where Pat was now steadying himself on a pole. The boy said,</p><br>
        <p>"Mr. I saw what happend to you and it isn't right! I'm sorry that fish tosser guy smacked you in the face
          with a fish, you didn't deserve that. Here, you can have my cookie but I think it may have got some salmon
          bits on it."</p><br>
        <p>Pat's eyes widened and his jaw dropped. He finaly knew what he would name his first cookie shop.</p><br>
