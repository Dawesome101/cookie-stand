          <h2>Pat is totaly awesome.</h2>
          <p>He's the kinda guy who does everything he can to help everyone he see's. Like helping little old ladies
            cross
            the street and getting cats out of trees. As cool as it is to be super nice, being nice wasn't Pats only
            goal
            in life. Pat wanted to be a cookie baker and was searching for the right idea to make his brand really stand
            out above the others.</p><br>
          <p>One day, while deep in thought, Pat was strolling down by pikes place market. The fish throwers were
            tossing
            fish back and forth like they always do and as chance would have it, one of those fish mongers loosed a
            sideways
            fish toss and the catcher lost control of it. It sailed through the air and struck good ol' Pat right
            in the face. Surprised, he stumbled back, arms stretched and bumped right into a little boy eating a
            chocolate
            chip cookie. The bump wasn't very hard, but it was just hard enough to send that cookie sailing out of his
            hand and right into the icy fish on display. The kid looked at his cookie, then back at Pat, then to the
            cookie again. For a second, it looked as if tears were welling up in his eyes but instead, the boy stood up
            straight and marched over to the cookie which was laying in the ice right next to the salmon. He grabbed it
            and walked over to where Pat was now steadying himself on a pole. The boy said,</p><br>
          <p>"Mr. I saw what happened to you and it isn't right! I'm sorry that fish tosser guy smacked you in the face
            with a fish, you didn't deserve that. Here, you can have my cookie but I think it may have got some salmon
            bits on it."</p><br>
          <p>Pat's eyes widened and his jaw dropped. He finally knew what he would name his first cookie shop.</p><br>
